>>> BELOW, I'LL OUTLINE THE STEPS TO UNCOVER THE VULNERABILITIES AND CAPTURE THE FLAG.

Solution Steps
Initial Recon
Started by [e.g., examining the webpage source code]. Noticed [initial observation, e.g., a login form with no visible validation].
Vulnerability Discovery
[Placeholder for your vulnerabilities. Describe what you found, e.g., an unprotected endpoint or misconfigured input field.]
Exploitation
[Placeholder for exploitation steps. Explain how you exploited the vulnerabilities, e.g., crafted a payload or bypassed authentication.]
Capturing the Flag
After [final step, e.g., gaining access to the admin panel], the flag was revealed: [e.g., FLAG{example_flag_here}].
Conclusion
This challenge was a great exercise in [e.g., identifying common web vulnerabilities]. Key takeaways include [e.g., the importance of input sanitization]. Stay tuned for more write-ups!
