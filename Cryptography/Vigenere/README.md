# Vigenere

An ancient message awaits, hidden behind the shifting veil of
a classic Vigenère cipher. The key to its secrets is not a simple
word, but a twisted whisper: cnffjbeq. Unravel the key's
disguise, and the message will reveal itself. Good luck.

## Solution

1. Identify the cipher as Vigenere.
2. Use the key "password" (hinted or guessed).
3. Decrypt the ciphertext to reveal the flag.
