Look carefull words can appear horizontally or vertically.
Some letters might overlap, just like in a real network puzzle.

## Solution Analysis

### Step 1: Solving the Word Search

The first step was to locate the specific networking terms hidden in the letter grid. Upon analysis, the words were found horizontally.

By crossing out the known words, we were left with unused characters in the grid rows:

| Row   | Words Found   | Remaining Letters (Garbage Data) |
| :---- | :------------ | :------------------------------- |
| **1** | `vpn`         | **j, b, e, q**                   |
| **2** | `log`         | **f, r, n, e**                   |
| **3** | `hack`, `ip`  | **p**                            |
| **4** | `sql`         | **u, h, a, y**                   |
| **5** | `bug`         | **b, p, x, r**                   |
| **6** | `cipher`      | **q**                            |
| **7** | `dns`, `keys` | _(None)_                         |

### Step 2: Extracting the Ciphertext

Reading the remaining letters from top to bottom, left to right, we extracted the following string:

> **Ciphertext:** `jbeqfrnepuhaybpxrq`

### Step 3: Decoding

The string looked like a substitution cipher. Given the context of CTFs and the string length, **ROT13** (Caesar Cipher +13) is a standard first attempt.

Applying ROT13 to the string:

Input: j b e q f r n e p u h a y b p x r q
↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓
Output: w o r d s e a r c h u n l o c k e d
