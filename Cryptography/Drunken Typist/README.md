# Drunken Typist

Someone tried to send the flag after midnight... judging by the keyboard, they missed. Can you fix it?

## Solution

1. The ciphertext represents keys hit by mistake, one key to the right of the intended key on a QWERTY keyboard.
2. Shift each character one key to the left (e.g., 'w' -> 'q', 's' -> 'a').
3. Run `script.py`.

## Flag

`CSC26{c023109e5e939e1996cfbf68346a}`
